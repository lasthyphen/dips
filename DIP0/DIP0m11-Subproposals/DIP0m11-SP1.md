## Application Form
    
- **Motivation**
    - Dijets Improvement Proposals Framework requires a DIP Editor to enforce the administrative and editorial aspects of the DIPs process and framework. Acting as Dijets Interim Governance Arbiter (until the council appointee assumes said role), the Core Team is proposing DGC Member, Alisha Ramazannezhad to take on the DIP Editor role. As the DIP Editor, Alisha will enforce, support, manage and organise the DIPs for there progression towards the voting phase. For a complete breakdown of the DIP Editor's role and responsibilities visit [DIP0m9: DIP Editor Role](https://github.com/Dijets-Inc/dips/blob/master/DIP0/dip0.md#dip0m9-dip-editor-role).
    - Being a member of Dijets Council, Alisha is fully familiar with Dijets Ecosystem and its Governance Models, DIPs framework and how it operates.
    - Alisha's main responsibility will be to actively work with the rest of the council members to help sheppard incoming DIPs and communicate with Governance Arbiter(s) on coordinating polls and mandate votes in conformance with Dijets monthly governance cycle.
    - It should be noted that the publication and ratification of DIPs Framework under the Founder's Mandate requires the program to start out with a DIP Editor already in place. The expectation is that the council including Member Alisha can decide upon appointing further Editor(s) should there be a need for it, provided the framework was afforded time to mature.
