I am proposing a DIP introducing the formation of "Kernels" within Dijets Governance. As members of Dijets Council I believe we are well aware of the objectives and responsibilities we each share within the Governance framework. And while I am confident of each member's commitment and skillset in fulfilling their responsibilities I also feel that the council can set about achieving its primary objectives only after it has first identified and addressed the operational aspects of undertaking any tasks we believe are in the best interest of Dijets. 

# What is a Kernel?

In order to achieve Dijets Council's primary objectives, a large number of operational factors need to operate in a synchronized workflow. This can only be made possible by formulating an operational structure of decentralised groups or sub-committees that can execute pre-defined necessary tasks in order to achieve the Council's long term goals. Each of this group or sub-committee will be termed as the governance kernel with a prefix describing its core function. And I propose a DIP for the formation of the very first group of its kind - **Executive Kernel** with a sub-proposal nominating myself as its **Chair**

# Formation and Structure:

To avoid any conflict of interest or responsibilities, Kernels can only operate within Dijets Governance Framework. That is to function primarily within the governance domain and build strategies, processes, human capital etc for the principal reason of helping to fulfil the Council's objectives. As the ecosystem grows I foresee the formation of different workforces as sub-committees overseeing other operational factors for example: Technical Kernel, Compliance Kernel, Strategy Kernel etc. Each Kernel will be responsible for a specific vertical within the functionality of Dijets Domains, and will be managed by one individual who oversees the Kernel and will be responsible for defining the long-term work areas and for covering a broad set of responsibilities for the benefit of Dijets Ecosystem. 

Kernels can be proposed in line with DIPs framework and voted on by the council. Each Kernel can only be brought into existence within Dijets Governance by submitting a DIP with three subproposals and two process modules:

# Subproposals:

1. Kernel Mandate - Subproposal that defines the **NAME** and **FUNCTION** of the Kernel.
2. Kernel Chair - Subproposal that defines the individual chairing the Kernel.
3. Kernel Budget - Subproposal that defines the Budget of the Kernel (Only if applicable. In the case of a Kernel DIP not requesting for specific budget, the subproposal can be submitted with N/A written in its preamble).

# Process modules:

Just as DIP0 defined the process for onboarding core personnel. We can use similar modules for adding and removing of Kernels. 
The naming convention for the DIP and the process modules can follow the Dip-Editor's advice.

1. DIP()SP(): Adding a Kernel.
1. DIP()SP(): Removing a Kernel.
1. DIP()SP(): Making changes to an existing Kernel.


# Summary:

I truly believe that to help Dijets achieve its maximum potential which in turn benefits everyone involved, we need to first come up with DIPs that first define and describe the "structure-for-the-structure" otherwise we risk ambiguity and a cluttered approach to resolving big picture issues. Considering the stage we are at, I believe the sooner we start implementing key DIPs the better it would be for Dijets. In summary Kernels act as the basic unit of work that provide operational structure and avoids fragmentation across Dijets Governance and how we go about achieving its main objectives. Kernels can be proposed by submitting a DIP with 3 subproposals and  3 process modules I described above. I am open to feedback, suggestions and queries. I will be submitting the proposal to the DIP-Editor after fleshing out some of its key details.
