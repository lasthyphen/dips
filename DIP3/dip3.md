## Sentence Summary

DIP3 divides Dijets Ecosystem into 5 principal domains and assigns each one with an index of its core units.

## Paragraph Summary

The goal of having principal domains is to give the council a complete overview of what specific DIPs are used to address which specific division/domain of Dijets Ecosystem. By having these principal domains declared from the outset and in place, the council can work towards reforming, upgrading and governing specific parts of the Ecosystem while complexity, ambiguity and dependency issues can be kept in check. 

## Modules Summary

**DIP3m1: Add Principal Domains**

DIP3m1 can be used as a sub-proposal to add further principal domains.

**DIP3m2: Amend/Remove Principal Domains**

Amend or completely remove an existing principal domain classification from the DIPs.

**DIP3m3: Add a new index to the proposed Principal Domain**

DIP3m3 can be used as a sub-proposal to add more indices to the principal domain.

**DIP3m4: Removal or Amendment of an Indexed Unit from the principal domain**

The expectation is that these classifications will go through many modifications and any changes, removals or additions/replacements to
an accepted Principal Domain category will require a subproposal submission and it being accepted.


## Motivation

Principal Domains should facilitate a structured and organised approach to formulating DIPs that are precise in addressing specific problems, and concise with exploring opportunities within the respective domains. It ensures that no aspect of the ecosystem is overlooked and provides a systematic framework for collaboration and coordination between the council and the organisation personnel. By dividing the entire Dijets ecosystem into core units belonging to individual domains, the overall process for DIPs becomes more manageable and conducive to effective implementation.
